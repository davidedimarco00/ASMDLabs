# Large Language Model - Primer
## Practical Guide to Large Language Models Usage

This primer covers the essentials of working with Large Language Models (LLMs) for various applications. You'll learn:

1. How to programmatically interact with LLMs
2. How to leverage embeddings for text similarity search
3. How to generate text using LLMs
4. Some prompt engineering techniques
5. A simple application with an LLM in the loop

## Requirements

We'll use the `ollama` library to download and run pre-trained LLMs.
We will also leverage gemini as a reference for state of the art LLMs.

- Install the library following instructions in the [official repository](https://ollama.com/download)
- Download the required models:
```bash
# Small LLM model
ollama pull smollm2:135m

# Large embedding model
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large

# Good performing SLM model
ollama pull qwen3.5:0.8b
```

To check the available models, run:
```bash
ollama list
```
To verify the local installation, just run:
```bash
ollama run smollm2:135m
```

For this primer, we'll use:
- `smollm2:135m` - a small LLM model
- `mxbai-embed-large` - a large embedding model
- `qwen3:0.6b` - as a good performing SLM model
- A recent model from google (gemini or gemma) as gold reference (please get the gemini api from here: https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys)


Feel free to experiment with other models to compare performance.

While ollama is accessed via HTTP requests, we'll use [langchain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) to simplify interactions. We'll also use the `smile` library for visualizations and mathematical operations.

## Project Structure

The project is organised into several sections:

### Core Examples

- **`it.unibo.basics`**: Core LLM interaction classes
    - `EmbeddingBaseExample`: Demonstrates embedding-based text similarity search
    - `EmbeddingVisualizationAndSearch`: Shows embedding visualization and search techniques
    - `TextGenerationExample`: Covers text generation with LLMs

- **`it.unibo.chat`**: Contains examples of agent-to-agent interactions

- **`it.unibo.prompt`**: Demonstrates prompt engineering techniques to enhance LLM performance

### LLM-in-the-Loop Applications

- **`it.unibo.tictactoe`**: A Tic Tac Toe game with an LLM-powered AI opponent (MVC architecture)
    - `model` — Domain model: `Board`, `Player`, `TicTacToe` game logic
    - `view` — Swing-based GUI: `SwingTicTacToeView`, `BoardView`
    - `controller` — Game orchestration and AI integration:
        - `GameController`, `PlayerLogic`, `UserPlayer` — game flow and human input
        - `AIPlayer` — LLM-backed player with retry and fallback logic
        - `controller.prompt` — `TicTacToePrompt`, `JsonMovePrompt` — prompt construction for the AI
        - `controller.parser` — `MoveParser`, `GsonMoveParser`, `RegexMoveParser` — response parsing strategies
        - `controller.formatter` — `BoardFormatter`, `TextBoardFormatter` — board-to-text formatting for prompts
    - `App` — Entry point (human vs. AI)
