# Exercise: AI-Powered Interactive Story (MVC)

Build an interactive text-adventure game where an LLM generates the narrative, questions, and
choices dynamically.
The player makes decisions that affect their stats until the story ends.

## Exercise 0 — Study and Understand

The provided codebase contains the main abstractions and implementations for a simple interactive
story engine. It is organised into the following packages:

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `e1.model` | `Story` , `StoryImpl`, `Player`, `StoryResponse` — the domain model. |
| `e1.engine` | `StoryEngine`, `LLMStoryEngine`, `JsonCodec` — LLM communication layer. |
| `e1.prompt` | `StoryPrompt`, `BeginPrompt`, `AdvancePrompt` — prompt construction. |
| `e1.view` | `StoryView`, `ConsoleStoryView` — user interaction (console-based). |
| `e1` | `StoryApp` — the application entry point and game loop. |

Read through the code, understand how the pieces fit together, and identify where you will
work in the exercises below.

## Exercise 1 — StoryPrompt (`e1.prompt`)

Look at the `StoryPrompt` interface and its implementations.
Your task is to create two concrete prompt classes:

1. **`BeginPrompt`** — for starting a new story.
   It receives the player's name, initial stats, and a setting description.
2. **`AdvancePrompt`** — for advancing the story.
   It receives the current player state, the previous question, and the player's chosen action.

When implementing `toPromptString()`, ensure the generated prompt is well-structured so the LLM
can understand it. In particular:

- Include clear instructions for the LLM to produce a narrative, a question, and a list of choices.
- Follow prompt-engineering best practices: be explicit about the response format you expect
  (e.g., a JSON object with specific fields) and provide an example if necessary.
- Look at `StoryResponse` — the LLM's reply must match its fields (`narrative`, `question`,
  `choices`, `updatedPlayer`, `gameOver`), because `JsonCodec` will deserialise the raw text
  directly into that record.

## Exercise 2 — Test LLMStoryEngine (`e1.engine`)

`LLMStoryEngine` is the implementation of `StoryEngine` that delegates to an LLM via `ChatModel`.
It already handles retries and JSON decoding; your task is to **test** that the surrounding logic
is consistent with the expected flow.

Using a **mocked** `ChatModel` (e.g., with Mockito), verify the following scenarios:

1. **Happy path** — the model returns valid JSON on the first attempt; the engine parses it
   correctly and returns a `StoryResponse`.
2. **Retry and recover** — the model returns garbage on the first attempt(s) but valid JSON on a
   later attempt; the engine retries and eventually succeeds.
3. **All retries exhausted** — the model never returns valid JSON; the engine throws after
   the configured number of retries.
4. **Malformed JSON** — the model returns syntactically invalid JSON; the engine treats it as a
   failed attempt and retries.

## Bonus — R&D and Extensions

These are open-ended tasks for further exploration and experimentation.

- **Story memory / context window:**
  LLM calls are stateless — each request is independent. Create a `ContextPrompt` (or a
  prompt decorator) that appends a summary of previous beats to the current prompt, giving the
  LLM long-term coherence. Consider the trade-off between context length and token cost, and
  experiment with summarisation strategies (e.g., keep only the last *N* beats, or ask the LLM
  to condense the history into a single paragraph).
